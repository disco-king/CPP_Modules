# CPP_Modules
These directories contain simple programs that were created as learning excersises for 42 curriculum. Each of them covers a topic in basic C++ programming like classes, inheritance, function overloading, templates and so on.
The programs are not supposed to have any real functionality and are purely aimed at explaining basic C++ language facilities. All the code in this repository was written by myself, feel free to explore
